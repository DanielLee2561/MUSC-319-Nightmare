# MUSC 319 Nightmare

**Description**

- This electroacoustic work was performed at the 2021 UBC WinterBang! Festival, featuring audio processes inspired by the techniques of musique concrète. It draws notable inspiration from Else Marie Pade, a member of the Danish Resistance during World War II.
- Musique concrète is a form of experimental music that, unlike traditional music, involves the processing of ordinary sounds. For example, this project incorporates sounds such as tapping, blowing, moving water in a bottle, rolling marbles in a jar, rubbing, hitting a pot with a spoon, and closing a book. They are then processed through techniques such as altering speed, reversing, looping, volume modulation, panning, and cross-fading, transforming them beyond recognition of their original sound.
